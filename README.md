Is a BurpSuite extension which will help pentesters automatically detect CORS and JWT misconfigurations through many test cases. This was created to avoid the hurdle of manual testing while there are in-depth areas where time should be put on. Currently, It only supports the stated before misconfigurations, but code & new checks will be pushed as soon something feasible show up on the way.
